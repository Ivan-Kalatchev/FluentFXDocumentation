It's free and open source.

FluentFX is a JavaFX library that comes with a theme and some controls. This is the core project but it has an icons library too - [https://github.com/Ivan-Kalatchev/FluentIconsFX](https://github.com/Ivan-Kalatchev/FluentIconsFX). FluentFX takes care of the "front-end" part of the project.
